P: What does page 0 contain?
A: .text .data

P: What is in page 2?
A: the process' stack

P: When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1?
A: No, page 1 is an invalid guard page which xv6 places right below the stack. If the user stack overflows and the process tries to use an address below the stack, the hardware will generate a page-fault exception because the mapping is not valid.

P: Explain why the third test srcva + len < srcva is necessary in copyin_new()?
A: To avoid add overflow.
